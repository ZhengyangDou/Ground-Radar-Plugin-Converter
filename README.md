# Ground-Radar-Plugin-Converter
This work is a conversion plugin that converts data into the EuroScope Ground-Radar-Plugin. I believe you can understand how to use it by looking at the code, since it's not difficult to do so. If you want to create a more sophisticated version, I recommend that you manually create it.

此作品是由数据转换成EuroScope Ground-Radar-Plugin的转换插件，使用方法我相信能看代码看懂的毕竟不难，如果你要更精细的制作这边建议你手搓配置文件
